# Data
## Description 
- The dataset contains information on individuals' health parameters, with columns representing different attributes. These include Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (ATA, NAP, ASY, TA), Resting Blood Pressure (RestingBP), Cholesterol levels, Fasting Blood Sugar (FastingBS), Resting Electrocardiographic Results (RestingECG), Maximum Heart Rate (MaxHR), Exercise-Induced Angina (ExerciseAngina), ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (Oldpeak), ST segment slope (ST_Slope), and the presence or absence of Heart Disease (HeartDisease).
- Each row corresponds to a unique individual, providing a snapshot of their health profile. The data appears to capture diverse information such as age, gender, cardiovascular symptoms, and various physiological measurements. The dataset is likely intended for analysis to identify patterns or factors associated with the presence of heart disease.
