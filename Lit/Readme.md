## Background:

- Sheu et al. (2022) provides a survey on medical XAI, focusing on recent progress, explainability approaches, human interaction, and scoring systems.
Medical XAI is important for understanding decisions and results from AI systems in healthcare, improving transparency and trust.
Motivation:

- Laws and ethics require explainability in high-impact medical AI applications. The "right to explanation" is enshrined in laws like GDPR.
XAI enables oversight, auditing, and human control over automated medical decisions. This is crucial for patient safety and accountability.
## Research Questions:

- What are the latest XAI methods and how can they be applied in healthcare?
- How to design effective XAI systems that provide meaningful explanations to humans?
- How to evaluate and quantify explainability?
## Methods:

- The paper systematically reviews recent literature on medical XAI applications including pneumonia, sepsis, AKI, etc.
- It summarizes key XAI techniques for data preprocessing, algorithms, evaluation.
- It proposes a novel XAI Recommendation System and XAI Scoring System.
## Results:

- Identified major XAI methods: attention mechanisms, knowledge distillation, surrogate models, feature importance techniques.
- Reviewed medical use cases and how XAI was applied.
- Presented characteristics of effective medical XAI systems.
- Proposed recommendation and scoring systems to improve XAI.
## XAI Relation:

- This comprehensive survey summarizes the state-of-the-art in medical XAI.
- It highlights the importance of explainability in high-stakes healthcare applications.
- The proposed recommendation and scoring systems aim to advance XAI capabilities.
- Overall, the paper demonstrates how XAI can enable trustworthy AI in medicine.
